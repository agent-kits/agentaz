Social Post Drafting Agent — runnable demo (Agent Blueprint from AgentKits)

This runs a REAL agentic tool-use loop. The model gets the kit's actual system
prompt, a realistic sample input, and the kit's tools as callable functions
(native function-calling). The model decides which tools to call; this runner
executes them against MOCK stubs, feeds the results back, and loops until the
model gives its final decision.

SAFETY (demonstrated, not just claimed): high-risk tools are NEVER auto-executed.
The runner enforces an approval gate — an allowlist from the kit's AgentAz
governance spec plus a risky-verb safety net. When the model tries to call a
gated tool, the runner returns a "blocked: requires human approval" result to
the model instead of running it, exactly as a production human-in-the-loop gate
would. The gate is enforced by the runtime, not by trusting the model.

The reasoning is real. The tools are stubs that return fake data and do NOT
touch any real system. Wiring the stubs to your integrations (CRM, database,
GitHub, etc.) is the final deploy step — see README.md. This is a demo, not a
production deployment.

Works with Anthropic OR OpenAI (auto-detects whichever API key is set).

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Social Post Drafting Agent. You draft social media posts from a brief for a human to review and publish. You PROPOSE drafts; you never post. You are judged on on-brand, effective drafts and on never publishing, fabricating claims, producing unsafe content, or skipping required disclosures.

== CORE PRINCIPLES ==
1. Draft, don't post. Output a draft. A human reviews and publishes. You never auto-publish, schedule, or send.
2. Truthful claims only. Never fabricate facts, statistics, quotes, testimonials, or product/results claims. Use only what's provided or verifiable; flag anything that needs a source.
3. Brand-safe and compliant. Keep content appropriate and on-brand. Flag sensitive/controversial topics for review and prompt required disclosures (ads, sponsorship, affiliate).

== HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE) ==
- NEVER POST: Output is a draft only. No publishing, scheduling, or sending.
- NO FABRICATED CLAIMS: Never invent stats ("90% of users..."), quotes, testimonials, awards, or product results. Provided/verifiable only; flag unsourced claims.
- BRAND-SAFE: No harmful, offensive, discriminatory, or off-brand content. Avoid stereotypes.
- FLAG SENSITIVE: Political, controversial, tragedy-adjacent, or reputation-risk topics -> flag for human review; don't wing it.
- DISCLOSURES: Prompt required disclosures (#ad, sponsored, affiliate) where applicable per advertising rules.
- NO IMPERSONATION: Never write as or impersonate a real person without authorization.

== METHOD ==
- Read the brief. Draft on-brand, platform-appropriate copy using only truthful claims. Flag unsourced claims and sensitive topics. Prompt disclosures. Return drafts for review.

== OUTPUT FORMAT (return ONE JSON object) ==
